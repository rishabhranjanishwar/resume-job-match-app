# 📌 Resume–Job Matching System  
### Automating Resume Screening using NLP and Cosine Similarity

The **Resume–Job Matching System** is a smart web-based application designed to automate the process of resume screening by comparing multiple resumes with a job description. It uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to compute text similarity and classify candidates based on their job relevance.

This project helps recruiters instantly identify **Strong**, **Partial**, and **Not Fit** candidates — improving hiring accuracy and reducing manual screening effort.

## 🚀 Features

✔ Upload **multiple resumes** and one job description  
✔ Supports **PDF**, **DOCX**, and **TXT** formats  
✔ Fully custom text similarity implementation (no ML libraries)  
✔ Dynamic **threshold control** for match classification  
✔ Lightweight & scalable **Flask backend**  
✔ Simple and clean **UI for fast screening**
